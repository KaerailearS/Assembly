/**
 * Project planning:
 * 
 * Questions to ask yourself before writing any code:
 * 
 * - What are the main containers of elements I need
 *   in this app?
 * 
 *  <main> that includes the entire project, one <div> for the <h1> and <p>, one <div> for the remaining programming languages(<p>?), one <div> for the answer line, and one <div> for the letter buttons 

 * - What values will need to be saved in state vs.
 *   what values can be derived from the state?
 * 
 *  Using similar logic to the Tenzies project, gameWon does not need to be saved in state, but simply as a variable. The answer and lives will need to be saved to state, to update the visuals of the answer line and remaining programming languages

 * - How will the user interact with the app? What
 *   events do I need to handle?
 * 
 *  Pressing buttons. Each letter needs a functioning button, as well as a "New Game" button once the game ends.
